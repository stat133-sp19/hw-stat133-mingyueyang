<font size="4">As the Wikipedia stated,

> <font size="4">“The Warriors' fortunes changed in the 2010s, ushering in a new era of success led by Stephen Curry. After drafting perennial All-Stars Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015, before winning another two in 2017 and 2018 with the help of former league MVP Kevin Durant.”

<font size="4">John Schuhmann, a professional journalist for NBA.com, commented that,

> <font size="4">"They're on pace to be just the fourth team in the last 20 years to make more than half their shots. And when you factor in the value of 3-pointers, their shots are more valuable than any of the 1,483 other teams that have played in this league. "

<font size="5">Every shot is money!

Now let's take a look at the shots charts for Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry respectively. From the shots chart, we can visualize the spots on the basketball court where each Warriors has made or lost shots. <img src="../images/gsw-shot-charts.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> <font size="4">We know that Stephen Curry has the highest number of total shots from the previous table. Here, we can see that the shots chart for Stephen Curry has the highest number of points. There is also a noticeable green arc along 3PT line, which corresponds to the fact that he has made the higest number of 3PT shots. Many people called him the greatest shooter in NBA history. His excellent shootng skill has won him six-time NBA All-Star, two-time Most Valuable Player(MVP), and three NBA championship with the Warriors. He is also credited with revolutionizing the basketball game by employing 3PT shots as part of winning strategy. <img src="../images/image7.jpg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<font size="4">Kevin Durant, according to the shots chart, is more excellent inside the 3PT line, especially near the rim. He joined the Golden State Warriors in 2016. "He chose an ideal roster fit and a shot at playing for the highest-scoring offense the NBA has seen in decades. He chose life alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the greatest shooting backcourt in history, and he chose to go against Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green, two elite defenders, in practices rather than in Western Conference finals games." commented by Ben Golliver on his move.

<font size="4">Klay Thompson, who has the second highest number of total shots, seems to be able to successfully shoot from anywhere. He is a key contributor in the Warriors. According to Wikipedia, in 2014, Thompson and teammate Stephen Curry set a then NBA record with 484 combined three-pointers in a season, earning the pair the nickname the "Splash Brothers". <img src="../images/image6.jpg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<font size="4">Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green make less shots than the previous three players, but they are both elite defenders and play a key role in the Warriors team.

**Go Warriors!**
